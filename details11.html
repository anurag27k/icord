        <p><b>The role of letter anatomy in Type Design: An eye-tracking study of Bengali
            letters.</b></p>

        of Design, IIT Guwahati).</p>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b> 
        Letter anatomy provides the information about structural formation of letterforms that are
        necessary during designing of letters. Letter identification is a fundamental phenomenon for reading a single
        letter or word or continuous text in any condition (Chahine, 2012). Without appropriate letter identification,
        reading is not comfortable enough. This paper discusses the process of Bengali letter identification. The aim
        here is to understand the role of specific letter feature in the letter identification process. Here, an eye-
        tracking study has been conducted to identify the involvement of letter features in reading. The test was
        performed with Bengali script and the letters were exposed to low contrast. It is presumed that the readers
        will identify the letters by their key structural aspect and such information will be captured by the eye-tracking
        device.
        The elementary unit of letter construction are the basic anatomical features of letterforms. The designation
        ‘anatomical feature’ indicates a specific letter-part that is unique in letter formation. The letter identification is
        a process of decoding and encoding of such structural information. They are the fundamental components of
        letter identification. This paper explains the process of Bengali letter identification and reveals the letter-part
        information by recognizing the anatomical feature. In order to reveal the letter features, we exposed the
        letters under visual stress to establish the significance of anatomical features. Pelli et al. already proved that
        the letters expose their features under condition of visual stress (Pelli, Levi, &amp; Chung, 2004; Pelli, Palomares,
        &amp;
        Majaj, 2004; Pelli, Burns, Farell, &amp; Moore-Page, 2006; Pelli, et al., 2006). In relation to the previous statement,
        an eye-tracking study was conducted under visual stress to understand the letter identification process of
        Bengali. The objective of the experiment is to direct the participants to identify the letters features during
        reading process. Here, we use the low contrast technique to hide letter stroke information that reduces the
        chance of getting recognised easily at once in the peripheral vision, but only recognizable in foveal vision.
        Participants have to read the letters with precise attention to identify letters under visual stress condition
        (Pelli, Burns, Farell, &amp; Moore-Page, 2006; Pelli, et al., 2006; Pelli &amp; Tillman, 2007).
        The study has been done to extract the information about the vital letter-parts that involves in letter
        identification process. The result indicates that there is an active involvement of specific letter-parts in letter
        identification process and a list of specific or distinctive letter features has been prepared to guide type
        designers. A letter is distinguished by the specific letter-part or parts from other letters during the course of
        letter identification process. The combination of common and unique (specific by definition) letter-parts make
        the letter unique in the identification process. It is essential to know such letter information that can be useful
        during designing of letterforms.</p>

        <p><b>Factors to look into for designing interiors of long distance
        pilgrimage buses in India: A survey based study.</b></p>
        
        <p>G Chinmaya Krishnan (Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati) and Debkumar Chakrabarti (Indian
        Institute of Technology, Guwahati).</p>
        
        <p><b>Abstract:</b>
            There are not many differences in buses used for long journeys for pilgrim-age purposes, with a
            common deluxe bus as regards to interiors. Passengers of different attitudes and comfort perceptions do
            differ. On inquiry to pilgrims and tour organizers in a preliminary investigation, it was noticed that sufficient
            attention is required to be given while designing the interiors of such public carriers but not much attention is
            paid so far, and no specific study was also carried out and normal buses with need-based modifications are
            being used. This may be due to the lack of in-depth knowledge about vehicle design, vehicle ergonomics etc.,
            and the lack of sufficient financial strength of these body building companies to employ knowledgeable per-
            sons. This study aims at understanding the critical factors affecting passenger physical comfort as concerned
            with interior aspects of buses for long journeys. The scope of the study is limited only to the buses operating
            under pilgrimage activities. The survey was done to find out those factors and the samples were taken from
            Vrindavan, Dwaraka and Somanatham. The pilgrims were selected based on purposive and random sampling
            as the target respondents were mostly senior citizens for whom the concept of comfort and fatigue are
            pronounced. Questionnaires and meeting observations were used to have their views on physical comfort,
            accessories and other facilities, seating considerations, the place for movements etc. The study finds certain
            issues that appear to be vital for designing long-distance pilgrimage purpose buses.</p>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b>
            Periodontists- Dental professionals associated with tooth scaling(cleaning) tasks are often prone to
            Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders(WMSDs). Tooth scaling involves the repetitive and forceful grip of
            scaling tool handle. Trauma related to hectic scaling job leave periodontists susceptible to upper extremity
            disorders like Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs) like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome(CTS) etc. Limited studies have
            been conducted to evaluate effect of tool handle design on upper extremity muscles involved in periodontal
            task. Optimally designed dental scaling tool design is expected to reduce the prevalence of WMSDs in
            periodontists. Twelve variations of modified dental scaling tool handle sleeves were fabricated using 3-d
            printing technology. Design parameters like diameter and shape were assessed while performing simulated
            scaling task. The individual and interactive effects of design parameters on upper extremity flexor/extensor
            muscles were recorded by Electromyography (EMG). Thumb pinch force readings were recorded
            simultaneously. Results of the study indicated the reduction in muscle and thumb pinch forces in octagonal
            handle having 11mm diameter. Proving taper to the tool handle design was also responsible for reduction in
            muscle loads. The current study not only aims at guiding the periodontists for adopting optimally designed
            tool but also engineers and researchers to design ergonomically sound tool handle designs.</p>
